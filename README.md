ðŸ”¢ Quasigroup Analyzer
Project Description
Quasigroup Analyzer is a C++ program designed to work with finite quasigroups, algebraic structures defined by a binary operation forming a Latin square. The program supports generating quasigroup Cayley tables (via cyclic groups, parametric/affine quasigroups, or sequential replacement graphs), checking for proper and nontrivial subquasigroups, and analyzing their properties. It includes an implementation of an affine quasigroup with the operation $(x \cdot y = \alpha x + \beta f(y) + c \mod n)$. The project is intended for educational and research purposes in algebraic combinatorics.
How to Run
Prerequisites

A C++ compiler (e.g., g++ with C++11 or later).
Standard C++ libraries (<vector>, <unordered_set>, <random>, etc.).
A terminal or command-line interface.

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd quasigroup-analyzer


Compile the Code:Use a C++ compiler to build the program. For example, with g++:
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o quasigroup_analyzer


Run the Program:Execute the compiled binary:
./quasigroup_analyzer


Interact with the Program:

Choose input methods (1â€“5) to generate or load a quasigroup:
1: Read Cayley table from a file.
2: Input Cayley table manually.
3: Generate a cyclic group $((x \cdot y = (x + y) \mod n))$.
4: Generate an affine quasigroup $((x \cdot y = \alpha x + \beta f(y) + c \mod n))$.
5: Generate via sequential replacement graph.
6: Exit.


Perform actions (1â€“6) to check for subquasigroups or save results.
Follow prompts to input parameters (e.g., order ($n$), coefficients ($\alpha, \beta, c$)).



Example
To generate an affine quasigroup of order 5:

Select option 4.
Enter (n = 5), ($\alpha$ = 2), ($\beta$ = 3), ($c$ = 1) (ensuring ($\gcd(\alpha, n)$ = 1), ($\gcd(\beta, n)$ = 1)).
View the generated Cayley table and check for subquasigroups.

Future Steps and Contributions
The project is open to contributions! Planned enhancements include:

Implementing a finite field ($GF(p^m)$) for constructing affine quasigroups.
Adding Dammâ€™s algorithm for quasigroup generation.
Optimizing the subquasigroup search algorithm (currently ($O(n^4)$)).
Supporting sequence encoding using quasigroup operations (e.g., transformation (E)).
